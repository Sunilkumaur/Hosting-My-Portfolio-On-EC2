Hosting a Resume/Portfolio in EC2 instance with CI/CD setup using GitHub

Followed the below steps to achieve this,
  1. Created a EC2 instance in AWS Console with Ubuntu OS and Security group allowing Port 80, Port 443 from anywhere in internet
  2. Along side created a KeyPair for the EC2 to make it accessible to the GitHub deployment/changes
  3. Stored the secrets in the Github from the EC2
  4. Created a YAML file for the CD/CI setup and so whenever a deployment/changes happens it triggers the changes to be get published in the EC2 lying source code of the Resume/Portfolio
  
What we acheived
  1. We made the GitHub to access the EC2 instance to update the source code of the Resume/Portfolio in the server whenever a changes/Deployment happening in the GitHub.
  2. the YAML file will take the responsiblity to deploy the new changes in the Git to the EC2 by running a simple SSH commands on it
